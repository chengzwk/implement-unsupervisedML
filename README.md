# Implement Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms

A hands-on project for implementing unsupervised machine learning algorithms in Python. This project aims to deepen understanding of algorithms and enhance Python coding skills by implementing K-means, anomaly detection, and other advanced unsupervised learning algorithms based on the Coursera [Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-learning-recommenders-reinforcement-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction) course.

## Description
This repository includes Jupyter notebooks with self-implemented unsupervised machine learning algorithms. In the coursed graded labs, we have implemented some parts of these algorithms, here I'll focus on implementing all parts of the algorithms independently, and put it all together for completeness and clarity. The repository includes implementations of:

- K-means clustering
- Anomaly detection
- A simple recommender system

Each notebook is structured to implement algorithms step-by-step, and test them on sample data from the course labs.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `tensorflow`


### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/implement-unsupervisedML.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   You can install the required libraries using pip or conda, for instance:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter-notebook
   ```

### Executing program

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter-notebook
   ```
2. Open any notebook to explore the implemented algorithms.

## Help

For troubleshooting common issues:
- If you encounter library import errors, ensure all dependencies are installed and compatible with your Python version.
- Jupyter Notebook may sometimes fail to start if conflicting versions of libraries are installed. Consider creating a virtual environment
